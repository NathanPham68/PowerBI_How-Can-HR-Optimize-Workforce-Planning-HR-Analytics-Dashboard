The Executive Summary page provides a high-level overview of the organizationâ€™s workforce health and key HR performance metrics. It tracks essential KPIs such as total headcount, salary expenses, turnover rate, average tenure, absence rate, satisfaction score, and average employee age. Visual breakdowns highlight workforce demographics â€” including gender and age distributions â€” and the main reasons for employee departures. In addition, turnover rates are shown by department, enabling leaders to pinpoint areas with higher attrition. This page helps senior management monitor trends, evaluate workforce stability, and make informed strategic decisions to improve retention and engagement.

### 3. Workforce Database

The Workforce Database page presents a comprehensive view of individual employee records. It consolidates detailed information such as employee names, positions, salaries, tenure, absence rates, satisfaction scores, recruitment sources, gender, marital status, performance ratings, retention risks, ethnicity, and employment status. This centralized database supports in-depth analysis of workforce composition, helps identify high-risk employees who may require retention efforts, and ensures HR teams have the data needed for proactive talent management and workforce planning.

Overall, this dashboard will help HR teams:
1) Better allocate resources
