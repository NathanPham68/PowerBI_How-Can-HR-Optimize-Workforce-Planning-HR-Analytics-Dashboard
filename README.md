## I. Introduction
This project is focused on creating a comprehensive HR Workforce Dashboard to help the organization track, analyze, and optimize important human resource metrics. By utilizing employee-level data, such as salary, tenure, absence, performance, and demographics, the dashboard provides insights that support evidence-based decision-making for talent management, employee engagement, and retention strategies.

I‚Äôve developed a data analytics solution that enables HR teams to make more informed decisions when it comes to workforce planning.

üëâ This tailored solution equips HR professionals and managers with the tools they need to make data-driven decisions in areas like workforce planning, employee engagement, and talent management strategies.

| **Field** | **Style** |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Satisfaction score** | - If 0 <= value <= 3 then ‚ùé<br> - If 3 < value <= 4 then ‚ùó<br> - If 4 < value <= 5 then ‚úÖ |
