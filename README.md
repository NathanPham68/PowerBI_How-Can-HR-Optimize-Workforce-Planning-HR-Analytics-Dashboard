## I. Introduction
This project is focused on creating a comprehensive HR Workforce Dashboard to help the organization track, analyze, and optimize important human resource metrics. By utilizing employee-level data, such as salary, tenure, absence, performance, and demographics, the dashboard provides insights that support evidence-based decision-making for talent management, employee engagement, and retention strategies.

I‚Äôve developed a data analytics solution that enables HR teams to make more informed decisions when it comes to workforce planning.

üëâ This tailored solution equips HR professionals and managers with the tools they need to make data-driven decisions in areas like workforce planning, employee engagement, and talent management strategies.

| **Field** | **Style** |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Satisfaction score** | - If 0 <= value <= 3 then ‚ùé<br> - If 3 < value <= 4 then ‚ùó<br> - If 4 < value <= 5 then ‚úÖ |
| **Retention Risk** | - If value is High then ‚ùé<br> - If value is Medium then ‚ùó<br> - If value is Low then ‚úÖ |

* High Earners: Top salaries belong to executives and IT leaders, with Janet King (President & CEO) earning $250,000.

* Retention Risk: Most employees have low retention risk, but a few ‚Äî such as Peter Monroe (IT Manager) ‚Äî have a high risk due to low satisfaction and ‚ÄúNeeds Improvement‚Äù performance.

* Satisfaction Trends: Scores range from 3.0 to 5.0. Low scores are often paired with medium-to-high retention risks.

## IV. Insights & Recommendations

| **Metrics** | **Insight** | **Recommendation** |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------|
| **1. Employee Turnover Risk** | - Length of service appears to have a strong correlation with job satisfaction and retention. Employees in the 1‚Äì3 year range are more likely to leave compared to long-tenured staff. | - Implement stay interviews to capture employee concerns before they resign.<br> - Introduce career pathing programs and ensure every employee has a clear 12‚Äì18 month development plan.<br> |
| **2. Performance Distribution** | - While top performers are present in all departments, there is a concentration of lower performance ratings in roles with less training investment.<br> - Performance gaps often align with inadequate onboarding and skills development programs. | - Increase investment in role-specific training, particularly for underperforming groups.<br> - Launch peer mentorship programs to transfer skills from high performers to less experienced staff. |
| **3. Compensation & Benefits Alignment** | - Benefits usage data indicates employees are either unaware of certain offerings or find them misaligned with their real needs. | - Adjust salary bands annually based on market trends and performance contribution.<br> - Review benefits packages to align with employee needs (e.g., flexible working, mental health support). |
| **4. Leadership & Engagement** | - Employee satisfaction is significantly higher in departments with visible, communicative leadership.<br> - Lack of regular feedback loops is a recurring issue, especially in larger teams where employees feel disconnected from decision-making. | - Increase skip-level meetings where senior leaders interact directly with employees.<br> - Foster a culture of continuous feedback using quick pulse surveys and regular check-ins. |
