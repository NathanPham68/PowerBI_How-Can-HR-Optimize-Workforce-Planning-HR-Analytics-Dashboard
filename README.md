# [POWER BI] HR Analytics Power BI Dashboard
## I. Introduction
This project is focused on creating a comprehensive HR Workforce Dashboard to help the organization track, analyze, and optimize important human resource metrics. By utilizing employee-level data, such as salary, tenure, absence, performance, and demographics, the dashboard provides insights that support evidence-based decision-making for talent management, employee engagement, and retention strategies.

Iâ€™ve developed a data analytics solution that enables HR teams to make more informed decisions when it comes to workforce planning.

ðŸ‘‰ This tailored solution equips HR professionals and managers with the tools they need to make data-driven decisions in areas like workforce planning, employee engagement, and talent management strategies.

The Executive Summary page provides a high-level overview of the organizationâ€™s workforce health and key HR performance metrics. It tracks essential KPIs such as total headcount, salary expenses, turnover rate, average tenure, absence rate, satisfaction score, and average employee age. Visual breakdowns highlight workforce demographics â€” including gender and age distributions â€” and the main reasons for employee departures. In addition, turnover rates are shown by department, enabling leaders to pinpoint areas with higher attrition. This page helps senior management monitor trends, evaluate workforce stability, and make informed strategic decisions to improve retention and engagement.

### 3. Workforce Database

The Workforce Database page presents a comprehensive view of individual employee records. It consolidates detailed information such as employee names, positions, salaries, tenure, absence rates, satisfaction scores, recruitment sources, gender, marital status, performance ratings, retention risks, ethnicity, and employment status. This centralized database supports in-depth analysis of workforce composition, helps identify high-risk employees who may require retention efforts, and ensures HR teams have the data needed for proactive talent management and workforce planning.

## VII. Conclusion
Overall, this dashboard will help HR teams:
1) Better allocate resources

2) Address potential issues proactively

3) Implement targeted interventions

4) Improve overall organizational performance
